Everyone needs a vacation, that's why the ICY boys are taking the week off to reflect on the past. How to eat in the shower, the probability of actually living in a society, and maybe some sort of democratic reforms. Who can say? But please enjoy a buffet of highlights from the past thirty episodes.
