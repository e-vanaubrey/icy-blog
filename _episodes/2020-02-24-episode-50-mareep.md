After many hard weeks of toil in the podcast mines, the ICY chefs have finally uncovered the crown jewel of the show, episode 50. And they celebrate in grand style: an extended dive into La Croix Boys, some suspicious cooking methods, lots of letters, and even a bit of the old trivia. Of course deliciously cooked Mareep as well!

Plus the reveal for our website. All this and more on I Chews You 50!
