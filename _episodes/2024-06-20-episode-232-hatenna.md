Hats off to us for another hilarious episode, filled with puns and recipes galore! This week, we're cooking Hatenna so we're putting on our chef hats to find the best way to cook and eat our hats. We discover a new cereal mascot, discuss the ideal Shrek 2 retrospective and visit the Texas Road House for the floor peanuts.
