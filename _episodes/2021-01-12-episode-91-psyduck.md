Happy Chew Year! Here on the show we're celebrating the turn of the calander page with some very special episodes. Covering cool Pokemon that we missed the first time around. This week we head back to Gen 1 to lose our minds with Psyduck.

Along the way we discuss the funkiest topics: Kong, eggs, and Christmas carols.
