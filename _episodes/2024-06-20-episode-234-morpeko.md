We don't like you when you're hangry so we're back this week with another heaping helping of I Chews You, featuring the hangriest mon of all, Morpeko. This Pikachu clone is inspiring some respectful and some not so respectful recipes complete with clown restaurants, phallic chocolate and a whale of a Mail Horde.
