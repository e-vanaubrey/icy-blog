This week the hosts struggle to consume the big wolf known as Arcanine. Its mane too lush, its attitude too loyal. Evan takes things to the great plains, Ian considers life in a wolf infested Idaho, Ben concocts a Pokemon/Sweeney Todd scenario, and Jeremy questions the legitimacy of Hibachi in the Pokemon world. All this and more on I Chews You.
