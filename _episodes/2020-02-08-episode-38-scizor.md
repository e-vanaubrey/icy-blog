I Chews You wishes the world a Happy Thanksgiving with this stuffed to the gills episode of the show. We cut to the heart of the best recipes for Scizor, read your emails, and update our thoughts on Sword and Shield.



Also there are some minor technical hiccups towards the end, our sincerest apologizes, but they couldn't be fully removed.
