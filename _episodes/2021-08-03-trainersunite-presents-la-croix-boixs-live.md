This week we're doin it live again with a special full length episode of everyone's show within a show: La Croix Boixs! In collaboration with Pokethon, we livestreamed this sparkling water spectacular for their #TrainersUnite event which raised money for the Stop AAPI Hate organization. Join Evan, Ian and Ben as they discuss tier rankings for every La Croix flavor, Poke-food pairings for the superior picks and some miscellaneous Waillord's Mail Horde to round it out!

Our donation page for Stop AAPI Hate will be live till August 7th so you have until then to make a donation:
