Alola! This week is a party because not only is it the end to another amazing season it's also the 5 year anniversary of the show! So to celebrate we live streamed the episode, a multi-hour ICY-fest: featuring questionably concocted soda potions with Mug and Starry, our final Alolan recipes, the juiciest mimes, a beautiful mail horde and a brand new quiz segment. 

Thank you to everyone for listening over the years, we love you all and can't wait to bring you more ICY content soon! During the stream we raised over $250 for the Palestinian Children's Relief fund, if you want to contribute you can donate at <https://streamlabs.com/ichewsyoupodcast/tip>
