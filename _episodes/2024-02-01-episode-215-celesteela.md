Ring ring! This week we're cooking up Celesteela with Rae (aka June from Hang Up) and this time they're the one who will decide: which ICY chef needs a wake up call and which one had the best reception. He'll be judging our recipes but also ready to dish on niche sparkling water flavors, Sleepy Bear Tea cults and how talking about podcasts is just as fun as making out.
