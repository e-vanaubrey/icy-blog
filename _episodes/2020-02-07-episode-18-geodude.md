This episode rocks! The boys lose their minds as they try to come up with the best way to eat rocks. Does it involve eggs, eyes, or a magical pasta witch? Who can say.



Also: apologies for some echoey audio. Jeremy moved into his new apartment and didn't have all the baffling in place quite yet. But I can promise this ep is a hoot and a half.
